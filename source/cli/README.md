# dc-*

## Executive summary

This is a collection of assorted scripts, leveraging the dc library, meant primarily for my own use.

## The what

 * `dc-dev-icon`: generates mac and windows icon files from images
 * `dc-http`: a simple, json-fancy wrapper around curl
 * `dc-iso`: manipulate ISOs files on macOS (create, mount, unmount)
 * `dc-kingpin`: a ridiculously stupid bootstrapper to setup pyenv, nvm, and gvm, and their most useful accompanying versions
 * `dc-libre`: allows direct access to any methods in the library
