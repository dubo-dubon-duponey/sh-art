## Executive summary

This is a collection of assorted scripts, leveraging the dc library, meant primarily for my own use.

## The what

 * `dc-http`: a simple, json-fancy wrapper around curl
 * `dc-imdb`: retrieve information for a movie from imdb
 * `dc-libre`: allows direct access to any methods in the library
 * `dc-mk-iso`: make an iso from a folder
 * `dc-movie-info`: use ffprobe to spit out data from media files
